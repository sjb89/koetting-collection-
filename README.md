During my studies at University of Maryland Global Campus, I came across the James Koetting Ghana Field Recording Collection, 
which seemingly became defunct sometime around mid-July (based on Wayback's archives). I worked with Claude Opus 4.6 to modernize
and host a new version of the site for mine and my classmates' coursework.

What's included:

Recordings browser — all 142 reels and 686 tracks with a searchable interface and reel-by-reel browsing. 
Each track links directly to the Brown Digital Repository where you can listen.

Field Notebooks — all three notebooks with their loose inserts, linked to digitized scans in the BDR

Gallery — all 13 Kwasi Badu photographs with lightbox viewing

Essays — full text of the In Memoriam and Kleeman biography

Resources — Introduction, Database Design documentation, searchable Glossary of 34 Kasena musical terms, Bibliography (4 sections), and Discography

Credits — full attribution

Enjoy!
